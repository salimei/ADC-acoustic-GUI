# ADC-acoustic-GUI

The goal was, intially, just the creation of a GUI for the acoustic-ADC project. However, this turned out to be a lot of fun, so I decided to make it its own project. 

| Name  | Summary |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| serial_connection_try1.pde | GUI for visualization of sound sources |
| serial_connection_oop.pde |  sound wave source visulization |
| wavy_pde.pde | functionally the same as *serial_connection_oop.pd* | 

### serial_connection_try1.pde

Originally intended to be a GUI for the ADC-acoustic project, the aim changed to generating "cool-looking" waves. This could easily be turned into a simple GUI to visualize the source of sound waves by changing a few lines of code. 

### serial_connection_oop.pde and wavy_pde.pde

Similar to *serial_connection_try1.pde*, but using the principles of oop (object-oriented programming). This version is both much quicker and can support multiple wave objects at once.
